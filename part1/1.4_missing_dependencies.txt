Note: running everything with -it flags to see what happens and to get ability to input directly.

Solution:
sudo docker run --rm -it --name deps ubuntu sh -c 'apt update && apt install -y curl; echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

One might also create and run the container installing curl, commit the changes to an image and run the command on that image afterwards:
sudo docker run -it --name deps ubuntu sh -c 'apt update && apt install -y curl'
sudo docker commit deps mti/ubuntu-curl:latest
sudo docker rm deps
sudo docker run -it --name deps mti/ubuntu-curl sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

This approach would allow one to keep an image with curl already installed for future use.
